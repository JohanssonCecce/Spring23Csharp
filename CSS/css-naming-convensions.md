# What are the Naming Conventions for CSS Classes?

BEM we like

## The BEM Convention

BEM is a convention that attempts to divide the overall user interface into small reusable components.The abbreviation BEM stands for Block‑Element‑Modifier.

**Block:** encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.

Blocks are independent entities. A block could represent site navigation, a header, a footer, etc.

**Element:** parts of a block that have no standalone meaning.

Unlike a block, an element cannot be a standalone entity

**Modifier:** flags on blocks or elements.

A modifier is a variation of an existing object. For example, we might need the same component in three different background colors. In such situations, modifiers are very handy.

Syntax

    block__element--modifier
